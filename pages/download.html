<h2>Metadata Schema</h2>

<p>Each report has a metadata JSON file that describes the report.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<pre>
{
  "number": "R41330",
  "versions": [
    {
      "date": "2016-09-15T00:00:00",
      "title": "National Monuments and the Antiquities Act",
      "summary": "The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorizes ... from potential threats.",
      "formats": [
        {
          "format": "HTML",
          "sha1": "67193b9ccc8e2a41640eb140040bc6a08a8275ab",
          "filename": "files/20160915_R41330_67193b9ccc8e2a41640eb140040bc6a08a8275ab.html"
        },
        {
          "format": "PDF",
          "sha1": "7d9b5190fc6ef4f898d2e7b667dd7c0531831a19",
          "filename": "files/20160915_R41330_7d9b5190fc6ef4f898d2e7b667dd7c0531831a19.pdf"
        }
      ],
      "authors": [
        "Carol Hardy Vincent"
      ],
      "topics": [
        {
          "source": "IBCList",
          "name": "Federal Lands",
          "id": 314
        }
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}</pre>

<h3>Report Object</h3>

<p>The top-level object represents a CRS report and contains two fields:</p>

<pre>{
  "number": "R41330",
  "versions": [
   ...
  ]
}</pre>

<p>The <code>number</code> field is an identifier for the report assigned by CRS.</p>

<p>CRS may update a report. Each update is listed in <code>versions</code> as a Report Version Objects (see below). Because the metadata may change in each update, all of the metadata for a report besides its number is stored in the metadata of the versions. The versions are in reverse-chronological order, so the first entry has the most recent metadata.</p>

<h3>Report Version Objects</h3>

<p>Each report version has several fields:</p>

<pre>{
  "date": "2016-09-15T00:00:00",
  "title": "National Monuments and the Antiquities Act",
  "summary": "The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorizes ... from potential threats.",
  "formats": [
    ...
  ],
  "authors": [
    "Carol Hardy Vincent"
  ],
  "topics": [
    {
      "source": "IBCList",
      "name": "Federal Lands",
      "id": 314
    }
  ]
}</pre>

<p><code>date</code> is the publication date of the report (or updated report).</p>

<p><code>topics</code> comes from CRS metadata. (We do not use this to generate the Topic Areas on this website, however.)</p>

<p><code>formats</code> is a list of zero or more Report Version Format objects (see below).</p>

<h3>Report Version Format Objects</h3>

<p>Each report version is published in zero or more document formats. Each format looks like:</p>

<pre>{
  "format": "HTML",
  "sha1": "67193b9ccc8e2a41640eb140040bc6a08a8275ab",
  "filename": "files/20160915_R41330_67193b9ccc8e2a41640eb140040bc6a08a8275ab.html"
}</pre>

<p>The <code>format</code> is either <code>HTML</code> or <code>PDF</code>.</p>

<p><code>filename</code> specifies a URL at <code>https://www.everycrsreport.com/</code> where the file can be retrieved.</p>
